<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Teamify is a Team Management application that caters specifically to small businesses employing part-time staff. The frontend is powered by React Native and Typescript, while the backend boasts the efficiency of Javascript, Node.js and PostgreSQL for seamless data management. Elevating user authentication to a new level, we leverage the robust capabilities of Microsoft Azure's Vision API for facial recognition, ensuring a secure and modernized experience for both employers and employees.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

## Prerequisites

### Node.js and npm

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/.

### React Native CLI

Install React Native CLI globally by running the following command:

```bash
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git then navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd <project_directory>
```

Then install the project dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

To use the database you can setup a free PostgreSQL database using <a href="https://www.elephantsql.com/">ElephantSQL</a> and set up a Microsoft Azure account then get a Vision key and Vision Endpoint for their <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision">Vision API</a>. Then create a `.env` file in the backend folder and place the following inside:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<your_database_url>
VISION_KEY=<your_vision_key>
VISION_ENDPOINT=<your_vision_endpoint>
```

Once it's working run the following command to setup the SQL Database.

```bash
cd backend
node sqlsetup
```

You can run this to check if everything has been set up correctly.

```bash
node sqlsetup -c
```

Once setup then create another `.env` file in the root of the project and then add your computer's IP address so that it can connect to your computer for testing while in development. Follow the instructions here to get your computer's IP Address.

- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/find-your-ip-address-in-windows-f21a9bbc-c582-55cd-35e0-73431160a1b9">üñ•Ô∏è Windows</a>
- <a href="https://www.security.org/vpn/find-mac-ip-address/">üçé MacOS</a>

Once you know your computer's IP address then place it into the root `.env` file:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_IOS_SERVER_URL=<your_computers_ip_address>
```

Then run `npm start` to run the project and scan the QR code to load it on your iOS or Android device with Expo!
